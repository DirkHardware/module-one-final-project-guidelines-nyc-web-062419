# similar_task is conceptually similar to delete_similar, in that it iterates through a series of assignments and checks for duplicates.
# However it differs in that rather than deleting them, it merely passes a boolean value to can_shirk in shirk_task, which determines
# whether or not shirk_task will move forward and create a new assignment for a user while deleting the old assignment for the old user.
